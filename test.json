With Hayes’ help he kidnappedArthur and took him across the moor to the GreenMan. Hayes killed Heidegger, who was followingthem. James had not wanted anyone to get hurt, sohe had gone straight to the Duke and told him thewhole story.The Duke didn’t want the whole world to knowabout his problems, so he and Wilder arranged for Hayes to run away – but in fact the police arrested himat the railway station.

    "desc": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a large number ofstories about the detective Sherlock Holmes, most ofthem set in Victorian England. Although not all of thestories are about rich and powerful people, many ofthem are. The Duke, like many men of his time, wantsthe world to think that he is a good family man, whenin fact he has an illegitimate child and he is living apartfrom his wife. It is almost more important to him tokeep his reputation than it is to ﬁnd his son."
